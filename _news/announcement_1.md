Together with co-applicants Vidminas Vizgirda, Jun Zhao, and Georgia Best, we have been awarded a Public and Community Engagement with Research fellowship from the University of Oxford Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences (MPLS) Division.

The fellowship is designed to support researchers and professional services staff to develop public and community engagement with research initiatives that drive culture change and embed responsible research practices.

Our proposal was to pilot a cross-departmental youth advisory group for AI and data science research projects. A youth advisory group is a group of young people who provide advice and input to research projects that impact young people or may impact them in the future. Youth advisory groups are one way to make sure young peopleâ€™s voices are heard in the research process, which in turn ensures that research is relevant, responsible, and impactful. Youth advisory groups exist or have existed in other departments at the University of Oxford, including Medical Sciences and Social Sciences, but do not currently exist in MPLS.

We'll start recruiting young people and researchers who want to consult with the youth advisory group in October - watch this space!
