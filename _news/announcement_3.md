I've been accepted to the [MIT Media Lab Workshop on Benchmarks for Human Flourishing with AI](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/aha-flourishing-workshop/) taking place in October.

During the two-day workshop, I'll be collaborating with other researchers to develop robust benchmarks for evaluating AI's impact on human flourishing, namely comprehension and agency.
