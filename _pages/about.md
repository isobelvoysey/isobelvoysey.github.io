Hi, I'm Isobel and I'm a postdoc working on the [CHAILD project](https://chaild.org) at the University of Oxford.

I'm interested in using technology for social good, particularly with children. I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh on child-robot interaction, designing and evaluating a zoomorphic robot for animal welfare education. My supervisors were [Michael Herrmann](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-herrmann), [Lynne Baillie](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/academics/lynne-baillie), and [Joanne Williams](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/joanne-williams).

Alongside my research, I enjoy teaching undergrads about robotics and tech ethics, as well as participating in outreach activities to bring computer science and university-style learning to children and teenagers. Outside work, I like swimming, cooking, and cryptic crosswords.
